Font Choice and Consistency:
The use of "Oxygen Mono" for the body text provides a clean and readable look, while "Inter" for headings adds a touch of modernity.
Consistent font choices enhance the overall visual appeal and maintain a professional and cohesive design.

Color Scheme:
The background combines a linear gradient with an image, creating a visually appealing and dynamic backdrop.

Layout and Flexbox:
The use of Flexbox for centering content both horizontally and vertically ensures a responsive design that looks good on various screen sizes.
The layout is well-structured, with the main content centered and appropriately spaced, enhancing readability and focus.

Responsive Design:
Media queries are employed for responsive design, ensuring that the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from large desktops to smaller mobile devices.

Animations:
The use of keyframe animations, such as the fadeIn animation, adds a subtle yet effective touch to elements like the welcome message, enhancing the user experience.
Spacing and Padding:
Consistent use of margins and padding throughout the design contributes to a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing interface.

Proper spacing around elements prevents visual clutter and improves overall user experience.

Loading Overlay:
The loading overlay with a spinner provides visual feedback to users, indicating that the system is processing information.
The overlay ensures that users are aware of ongoing background processes without disrupting their experience.

Accessibility:
The use of relative units (em and rem) for font sizes enhances accessibility, allowing users to adjust text sizes based on their preferences.
